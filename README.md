### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

2. Handling missing and duplicate values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key question such as:
 - What is the relationship between gender and income of customers?
 - Does age have any effect on the number of bike sales?
 - What role does commute distance play in sales?

### Result/Findings
The analysis results is summarized as follows:
 1. The bike sales have been steadily increasing with males in relation to income of customers.
 2. People of midage have a better purchasing power in comparism with people of other age groups.
 3. Customers with short commuting distance should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
 - Invest in marketing and promotions towards the male gender and midaged.
   
### Limitations
